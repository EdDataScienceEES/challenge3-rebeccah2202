# PARTCIPATION
### This file is a summary of the feedback I received, the feedback I implemented and the feedback I gave. All feedback can also be found in the issues of the challenge repositories.

**Feedback Pippa gave me**   
Read.me:   
In your main readme file, I would cite where you got the picture of the turtle from.
Not sure what you mean by workflow script? Is this draft script before you landed on your Final script?   

Report:   
Cite the picture in your main report as well.
Really like how in your background you did a different paper for each country's conservation effort and that these countries are also in your data.
Get rid of the title on your graph.
Really good report!   

Workflow:   
Cool that it is handwritten   

Model process:   
Really like how you have a step by step work through of why you changed and what you changed in your models.   

Final Script:   
Everything runs up until your models (which is what you wanted so that is fine)
Double check you need all those libraries, I wasn’t sure because I wasn't able to run the model so I did not know if they were all necessary for the graph you made but on your laptop it is worth checking.
On your inline commenting sometimes you start with a capital and sometimes it starts with a lowercase letter. Change these to one or the other for consistency.
