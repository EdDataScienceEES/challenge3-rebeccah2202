**Loggerhead Sea Turtle *(Caretta Caretta)* Population Trends**

**Background**    
Understanding population trends of species is important to assess whether current management strategies are working or a revised conservation strategy is necessary (Ceriani, 2019). Estimating Sea turtle abundances is difficult, as they are marine organisms that disperse widely. Therefore, nests counts are used as an index of population trends, but should be translated into actual population trends (Ceriani, 2019).    

Previous research showed a decline in turtle populations globally and the loggerhead sea turtle is classified as an endangered species. As a result, extensive conservation efforts have been implemented in different areas of the world. In Brazil, conservation efforts were implemented in the 1980s which lead to a significant increase in abundances but there are emerging threats, so conservation efforts must be continued (Marcovaldi and Chaloupka, 2007). In South Africa, conservation programmes included the implementation of coastal Marine Protection Areas (MPAs) which also resulted in a dramatic increase in loggerhead sea turtle abundance (Nel et al., 2013). However, it is imoprtant to understand, that populations may start to decrease again, as an increase in the mean annual sea surface temperature may result in a decrease in food supply and therefore in reduced nesting (Chaloupka et al., 2008). Lastly, a study looking at sea turtle populations in Australia found that the nesting population has declined rapidly and that populations are at risk of extinction (Heppel et al., 1993).
