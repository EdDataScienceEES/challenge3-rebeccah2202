# Readings on Loggerhead Sea Turtle population trends and conservation

**Turtle populations Brazil**
Marcovaldi, M. Â., & Chaloupka, M. (2007). Conservation status of the loggerhead sea turtle in Brazil: an encouraging outlook. Endangered Species Research, 3(2), 133-143.
- substantial long-term increase in nesting abundance of this once depleted Atlantic stock following the cessation of egg and turtle harvesting in the 1980s - similar to what we see in our model - around 1980, 1990 still a low population that has significantly increased
- conservation efforts are likely the reason for the improving status of the Brazilian loggerhead abundance since the mid-1980s, but emerging threats such as incidental capture in coastal and pelagic fisheries may limit any further recovery - important to continue conservation efforts

**Conservation**
Ceriani, S. A., Casale, P., Brost, M., Leone, E. H., & Witherington, B. E. (2019). Conservation implications of sea turtle nesting trends: elusive recovery of a globally important loggerhead population. Ecosphere, 10(11), e02936.
- understanding population status and trends is important for developing and evaluating management and conservation actions for threatened species
- monitoring of marine animals difficult - nest counts as index of population trends
- despite extensive conservation efforts  - no evidence of strong population recovery in US
- We recommend maintaining a high level of protection, addressing persistent anthropogenic threats, continued collection of rigorous nest-count data, and monitoring reproductive parameters to better link nest counts to adult female population abundance.
- nest trends should be translated into at least adult female trends

**Australia**
Heppel, S. S., Limpus, C. J., Crouse, D. T., Frazer, N. B., & Crowder, L. B. (1996). Population model analysis for the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta, in Queensland. Wildlife Research, 23(2), 143-161.
- Worldwide declines of marine turtle populations have forced a need for sound conservation policies to prevent their extinction. 
- Loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, are declining rapidly at eastern Australian nesting beaches
- females nesting at Mon Repos, Queensland, a major rookery where the annual nesting population has declined at rates approaching 8% per year
- A loss of only a few hundred subadult and adult females each year could lead to extinction of the eastern Australian loggerheads in less than a century.
- Measures that protect adult and subadult loggerhead turtles should be supported

**Effect of climate change**
Chaloupka, M., Kamezaki, N., & Limpus, C. (2008). Is climate change affecting the population dynamics of the endangered Pacific loggerhead sea turtle?. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 356(1-2), 136-143.
- loggerhead sea turtle is an endangered species exposed to many anthropogenic hazards
- threats include fisheriesincrease in mean annual sea surface temperature
- whether a population was decreasing or increasing that there was an inverse correlation between nesting abundance and mean annual sea surface temperature 
- Cooler foraging habitat ocean temperatures are presumably associated with increased ocean productivity and prey abundance and consequently increased loggerhead breeding capacity. So warming regional ocean temperatures could lead to long-term decreased food supply and reduced nesting and recruitment 

**South Africa**
Nel, R., Punt, A. E., & Hughes, G. R. (2013). Are coastal protected areas always effective in achieving population recovery for nesting sea turtles?. PloS one, 8(5) e63525.
- coastal Marine Protection Areas (MPAs) have been used to facilitate the recovery of turtle populations
- South Africa, however, hosts one of the longest running conservation programs, protecting nesting loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles since 1963
- Loggerhead abundance increased dramatically from∼250 to>1700 nests pa (index area)
- coastal MPAs can work but do not guarantee the recovery of sea turtle populations as pressures change over time
