# PARTCIPATION
### This file is a summary of the feedback I received, the feedback I implemented and the feedback I gave. All feedback can also be found in the issues of the challenge repositories. This is also for me to keep track of which feedback I have already impemented and what I still need to change.

**Feedback Pippa gave me**   
Read.me:   
In your main readme file, I would cite where you got the picture of the turtle from. *done, added citations for both images*   
Not sure what you mean by workflow script? Is this draft script before you landed on your Final script?    

Report:   
Cite the picture in your main report as well. *done*   
Really like how in your background you did a different paper for each country's conservation effort and that these countries are also in your data.   
Get rid of the title on your graph. *I have removed it from the script and will add new figure to report*   
Really good report!    

Workflow:   
Cool that it is handwritten   

Model process:   
Really like how you have a step by step work through of why you changed and what you changed in your models.   

Final Script:   
Everything runs up until your models (which is what you wanted so that is fine)   
Double check you need all those libraries, I wasnâ€™t sure because I wasn't able to run the model so I did not know if they were all necessary for the graph you made but on your laptop it is worth checking. *There were three unnecessary packages which I have now removed. The script still runs without any issues.*   
On your inline commenting sometimes you start with a capital and sometimes it starts with a lowercase letter. Change these to one or the other for consistency. 
*All inline commenting now starts with a capital*
